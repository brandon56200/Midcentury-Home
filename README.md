Infrastructure and discovery platform for multimodal data intelligence.

## Harmoniq Benchmark

Harmoniq is a specialized benchmarking suite designed to evaluate the next generation of Speech-to-Speech (STS) AI models. Unlike traditional benchmarks that measure ASR or TTS in isolation, Harmoniq audits the complete voice interaction loop across three core intelligence pillars:

### Research Pillars
* **Speech Understanding**: Foundation-level comprehension of spoken content and semantic accuracy.
* **Voice Understanding**: Granular paralinguistic perception including emotion, identity, and speaker characteristics.
* **Speech Reasoning**: Cognitive fidelity testing to determine if logical reasoning survives the transition to audio-native modalities.

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built for high-fidelity data presentation and research-grade analysis:

* **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
* **Visualizations**: High-performance data auditing via ECharts
* **Animations**: Industrial-grade, looping technical graphics powered by Framer Motion
* **Type Safety**: Full-stack type safety with tRPC and TypeScript
* **Styling**: Specialized industrial aesthetic using Tailwind CSS

## Deployment

The application is optimized for the Vercel Edge Runtime. 

### Version Control
This repository is configured for automated deployments. Standardized metadata, including dynamic Favicon generation and OpenGraph social sharing assets, are handled at the root level via `src/app/icon.tsx` and `src/app/opengraph-image.tsx`.
